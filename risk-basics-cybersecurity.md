# Asset, Threat, and Vulnerability — and How They Relate to Risk

## 1. Asset
**Definition:**  
An *asset* is anything that has value to an organization and needs protection.

Assets can be:
- **Data:** customer records, passwords, source code, financial data  
- **Systems:** servers, laptops, databases, networks  
- **People:** employees, administrators  
- **Services:** websites, applications, business processes  
- **Physical items:** buildings, hardware

**Key idea:**  
> If losing it, exposing it, or damaging it would hurt the organization, it is an asset.

## 2. Threat
**Definition:**  
A *threat* is anything that has the potential to cause harm to an asset.

Threats can be:
- **Human:** hackers, insiders, careless employees  
- **Technical:** malware, ransomware, software bugs  
- **Environmental:** fire, flood, power outage  
- **Process-related:** poor policies, misconfigurations, lack of backups

**Key idea:**  
> A threat is the *possibility* of something bad happening to an asset.

---

## 3. Vulnerability
**Definition:**  
A *vulnerability* is a weakness that a threat can exploit.

Examples:
- Unpatched software  
- Weak passwords  
- Open ports not monitored  
- Default credentials  
- Improper access controls  
- No encryption  
- Lack of employee training

**Key idea:**  
> A vulnerability does not cause damage by itself — it needs a threat to exploit it.

## 4. How They Work Together: Understanding Risk

### Simple Formula

\[
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability
\]

This means:

- If there is **no threat** → risk is low.  
- If there is **no vulnerability** → risk is low.  
- If both exist → risk increases.

### Example

- **Asset:** Customer database  
- **Threat:** Hacker tries to gain access  
- **Vulnerability:** Weak admin password (`admin123`)

Because a threat *and* vulnerability both exist:

> The risk of data theft becomes high.

## 5. Why This Matters in Cybersecurity

Security teams focus on:

1. **Identifying assets** (What are we protecting?)
2. **Finding threats** (What could happen?)
3. **Detecting vulnerabilities** (Where are we weak?)
4. **Reducing risk** by:
   - patching systems  
   - enforcing strong passwords  
   - adding monitoring  
   - training employees  
   - using firewalls and encryption  

**Important truth:**  
> You cannot remove all threats — but you *can* reduce vulnerabilities, which lowers risk.

## 6. Quick Summary Table

| Term | Simple Meaning | Example |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Asset** | Something valuable | Customer database |
| **Threat** | Possible danger | Hacker attempts attack |
| **Vulnerability** | Weakness | Weak password |
| **Risk** | Chance of damage | Data breach happens |

---

## Final Takeaway

Assets are what we protect.  
Threats are what might attack them.  
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that allow attacks.  

**Risk happens when a threat successfully exploits a vulnerability.**
